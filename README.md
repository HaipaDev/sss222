# SSS222 / Super Space Shooter 2222
### Is a project I have been passionately working solo since March 2020, while learning Unity and C#
With some help from my friends including sprites for some skins, the bosses and dedicated soundtracks for them I made a Unity sequel to [my first GameMaker game I made back in 2017 as a 14 year old.](https://github.com/HyperGamesDev/sss77)
### I've released the [game on Steam on 31st August 2022](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2000190/SSS222_HyperSpace/) (which is the 5th anniversary of my first game)
## A fast-paced addicting endless space shooter with an inspiration taken from many modern games.
