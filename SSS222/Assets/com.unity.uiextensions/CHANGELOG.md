## Release 2.3 - Reanimation - 2022/02/07

It has been a tough time for all since the last update, but things have been moving steadily along.  In the past few months there has been a concerted effort to revamp and update the project ready for Unity 2022, as well as migrating the source repository over to GitHub and refreshing all the things.
We hope the new release is better for everyone and we have paid close attention to the editor menus and places to find all the controls for this release.

## Breaking changes

For customers upgrading from earlier versions of Unity to Unity 2020, please be aware of the Breaking change related to Text Based components.  You will need to manually replace any UI using the older ```Text``` component and replace them with ```TextMeshPro``` versions. This is unavoidable due to Unity deprecating the Text component.

> New users to 2022 are unaffected as all the Editor commands have been updated to use the newer TextMeshPro versions.

For more details, see the [deprecation notice](https://github.com/Unity-UI-Extensions/com.unity.uiextensions/discussions/428) on GitHub.

## Additional Notes

### [Installation Instructions](https://unity-ui-extensions.github.io/UPMInstallation.html)

The recommended way to add the Unity UI Extensions project to your solution is to use the Unity package Manager. Simply use the Unity Package Manager to reference the project to install it

New for 2020, we have added OpenUPM support and the package can be installed using the following [OpenUPM CLI](https://openupm.com/docs/) command:

```cli
`openupm add com.unity.uiextensions`
```
> For more details on using [OpenUPM CLI, check the docs here](https://github.com/openupm/openupm-cli#installation).

- Unity Package Manager - manual

Alternatively, you can also add the package manually through the Unity package manager using the scope ```com.unity.uiextensions```, see the [Unity Package Manager docs](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/the-package-manager) for more information.

- Unity 2018 or lower
The pre-compiled Unity assets are the only solution for Unity 2018 or earlier due to the changes in the Unity UI framework in Unity made for 2019.
Either clone / download this repository to your machine and then copy the scripts in, or use the pre-packaged .UnityPackage for your version of Unity and import it as a custom package in to your project.

### Upgrade Notes

### UPM

If you are using UPM to gain access to the Unity UI Extensions, then you only need to update to the latest version in the Package Manager, no other changes needed.

### Customers using the .UnityPackage

Due to the restructure of the package to meet Unity's new package guidelines, we recommend **Deleting the current Unity UI Extensions** folder prior to importing the new package.

For Unity 2019 users using the new UPM deployment, be sure to delete the existing folder in your assets folder before adding the new package to avoid conflict.
