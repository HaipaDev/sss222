# About Unity UI Extensions

The Unity UI Extensions project is a collection of extension scripts/effects and controls to enhance your Unity UI experience. This includes over 70+ controls, utilities, effects and some much-needed love to make the most out of the Unity UI system (formally uGUI) in Unity.

# Installing Unity UI Extensions

To install this package, follow the instructions in the Package Manager documentation.

For more details on [Getting Started](https://unity-ui-extensions.github.io/GettingStarted) please checkout the [online documentation here](https://unity-ui-extensions.github.io/).

# Using Unity UI Extensions

The UI Extensions project provides many automated functions to add the various controls contained within the project commonly accessed via "***GameObject -> UI -> Extensions -> 'Control'***" from the editor menu.  This will add the UI object and all the necessary components to make that control work in the scene in a default state.

Some of the features are also available through the GameObject "Add Component" menu in the inspector.

For a full list of the controls and how they are used, please see the [online documentation](https://unity-ui-extensions.github.io/Controls.html) for the project.

# Technical details

## Requirements

This version of the Unity UI Extensions is compatible with the following versions of the Unity Editor:

> Alternatively, the Asset packages have been tested to work with 2019 as well if you prefer to install that way.

- 2018 and below - for 2018 and use this package, you will have to import the asset package(s), either from the Asset Store or from the alternate download locations [listed here](https://unity-ui-extensions.github.io/Downloads).

## [Release Notes](https://unity-ui-extensions.github.io/ReleaseNotes/RELEASENOTES)

## Release 2.3 - Reanimation - 2022/02/07

It has been a tough time for all since the last update, but things have been moving steadily along.  In the past few months there has been a concerted effort to revamp and update the project ready for Unity 2022, as well as migrating the source repository over to GitHub and refreshing all the things.
We hope the new release is better for everyone and we have paid close attention to the editor menus and places to find all the controls for this release.

## Breaking changes

For customers upgrading from earlier versions of Unity to Unity 2020, please be aware of the Breaking change related to Text Based components.  You will need to manually replace any UI using the older ```Text``` component and replace them with ```TextMeshPro``` versions. This is unavoidable due to Unity deprecating the Text component.

> New users to 2022 are unaffected as all the Editor commands have been updated to use the newer TextMeshPro versions.

For more details, see the [deprecation notice](https://github.com/Unity-UI-Extensions/com.unity.uiextensions/discussions/428) on GitHub.
