# Addressable Assets development cycle
One of the key benefits of Addressable Assets is decoupling how you arrange, build, and load your content. Traditionally, these facets of development are heavily tied together. 

## Traditional asset management
If you arrange content in _Resources_ directories, it gets built into the base application and you must load the content using the [`Resources.Load`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Resources.Load.html) method, supplying the path to the resource. To access content stored elsewhere, you would use direct references or asset bundles. If you use asset bundles, you would again load by path, tying your load and organization strategies together. If your asset bundles are remote, or have dependencies on other bundles, you have to write code to manage downloading, loading, and unloading all of your bundles.

## Addressable Asset management
Giving an asset an address allows you to load it using that address, no matter where it is in your Project or how you built the asset.  You can change an Addressable Assetâ€™s path or filename without issue. You can also move the Addressable Asset from the _Resources_ folder, or from a local build destination, to some other build location (including remote ones), without ever changing your loading code.

### Asset group schemas
Schemas define a set of data. You can attach schemas to asset groups in the Inspector. The set of schemas attached to a group defines how the build processes its contents. For example, when building in packed mode, groups with the `BundledAssetGroupSchema` schema attached to them act as sources for asset bundles. You can combine sets of schemas into templates that you use to define new groups. You can add schema templates via the `AddressableAssetsSettings` Inspector.

## Build scripts
Build scripts are represented as [`ScriptableObject`](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-ScriptableObject.html) assets in the Project that implement the [`IDataBuilder`](../api/UnityEditor.AddressableAssets.Build.IDataBuilder.html) interface. Users can create their own build scripts and add them to the `AddressableAssetSettings` object through its Inspector. To apply a build script in the **Addressables window** (**Window** > **Asset Management** > **Addressables**), select **Build Script**, and choose a dropdown option. Currently, there are three scripts implemented to support the full application build, and three Play mode scripts for iterating in the Editor.

### Play mode scripts
The Addressable Assets package has three build scripts that create Play mode data to help you accelerate app development.

#### Fast mode 
Fast mode (`BuildScriptFastMode`) allows you to run the game quickly as you work through the flow of your game. Fast mode loads assets directly through the asset database for quick iteration with no analysis or asset bundle creation.

#### Virtual mode
Virtual mode (`BuildScriptVirtualMode`) analyzes content for layout and dependencies without creating asset bundles. Assets load from the asset database though the `ResourceManager`, as if they were loaded through bundles. To see when bundles load or unload during game play, view the asset usage in the [**Addressable Profiler window**](MemoryManagement.md#the-addressable-profiler) (**Window** > **Asset Management** > **Addressable Profiler**).

Virtual mode helps you simulate load strategies and tweak your content groups to find the right balance for a production release.

#### Packed Play mode
Packed Play mode (`BuildScriptPackedPlayMode`) uses asset bundles that are already built. This mode most closely matches a deployed application build, but it requires you to build the data as a separate step. If you aren't modifying assets, this mode is the fastest since it does not process any data when entering Play mode. You must either build the content for this mode in the **Addressables window** (**Window** > **Asset Management** > **Addressables**) by selecting **Build** > **Build Player Content**, or using the `AddressableAssetSettings.BuildPlayerContent()` method in your game script.

#### Choosing the right script
To apply a Play mode script, from the **Addressables window** menu (**Window** > **Asset Management** > **Addressables**), select **Play Mode Script** and choose from the dropdown options. Each mode has its own time and place during development and deployment. The following table illustrates stages of the development cycle, in which a particular mode is useful.

| | **Design** | **Develop** | **Build** | **Test / Play** | **Publish** |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Fast | x | x |   | In-Editor only |   |
| Virtual | x | x | Asset bundle layout | In-Editor only |  |
| Packed |   |   | Asset bundles  | x | x |

## Analysis and debugging
By default, Addressable Assets only logs warnings and errors. You can enable detailed logging by opening the **Player** settings window (**Edit** > **Project Settings** > **Player**), navigating to the **Other Settings** > **Configuration** section, and adding "`ADDRESSABLES_LOG_ALL`" to the **Scripting Define Symbols** field. 

You can also disable exceptions by unchecking the **Log Runtime Exceptions** option in the `AddressableAssetSettings` object Inspector. You can implement the [`ResourceManager.ExceptionHandler`](../api/UnityEngine.ResourceManagement.ResourceManager.html) property with your own exception handler if desired, but this should be done after Addressables finishes runtime initialization (see below).

## Initialization objects
You can attach objects to the Addressable Assets settings and pass them to the initialization process at runtime. The `CacheInitializationSettings` object controls Unity's caching API at runtime. To create your own initialization object, create a ScriptableObject that implements the [`IObjectInitializationDataProvider`](../api/UnityEngine.ResourceManagement.Util.IObjectInitializationDataProvider.html) interface. This is the Editor component of the system responsible for creating the `ObjectInitializationData` that is serialized with the runtime data.

## Content update workflow
Unity recommends structuring your game content into two categories: 

* **Static** content that you never expect to update. 
* **Dynamic** content that you expect to update. 

In this structure, static content ships with the application (or downloads soon after install), and resides in very few large bundles. Dynamic content resides online, ideally in smaller bundles to minimize the amount of data needed for each update. One of the goals of the Addressable Assets System is to make this structure easy to work with and modify without having to change your scripts. 

However, the Addressable Assets System can also accommodate situations that require changes to the "static" content, when you don't want to publish a whole new application build.  

### How it works
Addressables uses a content catalog to map an address to each asset, specifying where and how to load it. In order to provide your app with the ability to modify that mapping, your original app must be aware of an online copy of this catalog. To set that up, enable the **Build Remote Catalog** setting on the `AddressableAssetSettings` Inspector. This ensures that a copy of the catalog gets built to and loaded from the specified paths. This load path cannot change once your app has shipped. The content update process creates a new version of the catalog (with the same file name) to overwrite the file at the previously specified load path.

Building an application generates a unique app content version string, which identifies what content catalog each app should load. A given server can contain catalogs of multiple versions of your app without conflict. We store the data we need in the _addressables_content_state.bin_ file. This includes the version string, along with hash information for any asset that is contained in a group marked as `StaticContent`.  By default, this file is located in the same folder as your _AddressableAssetSettings.asset_ file.  

The _addressables_content_state.bin_ file contains hash and dependency information for every `StaticContent` asset group in the Addressables system. All groups building to the _StreamingAssets_ folder should be marked as `StaticContent`, though large remote groups may also benefit from this designation. During the next step (preparing for content update, described below), this hash information determines if any `StaticContent` groups contain changed assets, and thus need those assets moved elsewhere.

### Preparing for content updates
If you have modified assets in any `StaticContent` groups, you'll need to run the **Prepare For Content Update** command. This will take any modified asset out of the static groups and move them to a new group. To generate the new asset groups:

1. Open the **Addressables window** in the Unity Editor (**Window** > **Asset Management** > **Addressable Assets**).
2. In the **Addressables window**, select **Build** on the top menu bar, then **Prepare For Content Update**.
3. In the **Build Data File** dialog that opens, select the _addressables_content_state.bin_ file (by default, this is located in the _Assets/AddressableAssetsData_ Project directory.

This data is used to determine which assets or dependencies have been modified since the application was last built. The system moves these assets to a new group in preparation for the content update build. 

**Note**: This command will do nothing if all your changes are confined to non-static groups.  

**Important**: Before running the prepare operation, Unity recommends branching your version control system. The prepare operation rearranges your asset groups in a way suited for updating content. Branching ensures that next time you ship a new player, you can return to your preferred content arrangement.

### Building for content updates
To build for a content update:

1. Open the **Addressables window** in the Unity Editor (**Window** > **Asset Management** > **Addressable Assets**).
2. In the **Addressables window**, select **Build** on the top menu, then **Build For Content Update**.
3. In the **Build Data File** dialog that opens, select the build folder of an existing application build. The build folder must contain an _addressables_content_state.bin_ file. 

The build generates a content catalog, a hash file, and the asset bundles.

The generated content catalog has the same name as the catalog in the selected application build, overwriting the old catalog and hash file. The application loads the hash file to determine if a new catalog is available. The system loads unmodified assets from existing bundles that were shipped with the application or already downloaded.

The system uses the content version string and location information from the _addressables_content_state.bin_ file to create the asset bundles. Asset bundles that do not contain updated content are written using the same file names as those in the build selected for the update. If an asset bundle contains updated content, a new asset bundle is generated that contains the updated content, with a new file name so that it can coexist with the original. Only asset bundles with new file names must be copied to the location that hosts your content.  

The system also builds asset bundles for static content, but you do not need to upload them to the content hosting location, as no Addressables asset entries reference them.

### Content update examples
In this example, a shipped application is aware of the following groups:

| **`Local_Static`** | **`Remote_Static`** | **`Remote_NonStatic`** |
|:---------|:---------|:---------|
| `AssetA` | `AssetL` | `AssetX` |
| `AssetB` | `AssetM` | `AssetY` |
| `AssetC` | `AssetN` | `AssetZ` |

As this version is live, there are players that have `Local_Static` on their devices, and potentially have either or both of the remote bundles cached locally. 

If you modify one asset from each group (`AssetA`, `AssetL`, and `AssetX`), then run **Prepare For Content Update**, the results in your local Addressable settings are now:

| **`Local_Static`** | **`Remote_Static`** | **`Remote_NonStatic`** | **`content_update_group (non-static)`** |
|:---------|:---------|:---------|:---------|
|  |  | `AssetX` | `AssetA` |
| `AssetB` | `AssetM` | `AssetY` | `AssetL` |
| `AssetC` | `AssetN` | `AssetZ` |  |

Note that the prepare operation actually edits the static groups, which may seem counter intuitive. The key, however, is that the system builds the above layout, but discards the build results for any static groups. As such, you end up with the following from a player's perspective:

| **`Local_Static`** |
|:---------|
| `AssetA` |
| `AssetB` |
| `AssetC` |

The `Local_Static` bundle is already on player devices, which you can't change. This old version of `AssetA` is no longer referenced. Instead, it is stuck on player devices as dead data.

| **`Remote_Static`** |
|:---------|
| `AssetL` |
| `AssetM` |
| `AssetN` |

The `Remote_Static` bundle is unchanged. If it is not already cached on a player's device, it will download when `AssetM` or `AssetN` is requested. Like `AssetA`, this old version of `AssetL` is no longer referenced. 

| **`Remote_NonStatic`** (old) |
|:---------|
| `AssetX` |
| `AssetY` |
| `AssetZ` |

The `Remote_NonStatic` bundle is now old. You could delete it from the server, but either way it will not be downloaded from this point forward. If cached, it will eventually leave the cache. Like `AssetA` and `AssetL`, this old version of `AssetX` is no longer referenced.

| **`Remote_NonStatic`** (new) |
|:---------|
| `AssetX` |
| `AssetY` |
| `AssetZ` |

The old `Remote_NonStatic` bundle is replaced with a new version, distinguished by its hash file. The modified version of `AssetX` is updated with this new bundle.

| **`content_update_group`**  |
|:---------|
| `AssetA` |
| `AssetL` |

The `content_update_group` bundle consists of the modified assets that will be referenced moving forward. 

Here are the implications of this example:

1. Any changed local assets remain unused on the user's device forever.  
2. If the user already cached a non-static bundle, they will need to re-download the bundle, including the unchanged assets (in this instance, for example, `AssetY` and `AssetZ`). Ideally, the user has not cached the bundle, in which case they simply need to download the new `Remote_NonStatic` bundle.
3. If the user has already cached the `Static_Remote` bundle, they only need to download the updated asset (in this instance, `AssetL` via `content_update_group`). This is ideal in this case. If the user has not cached the bundle, they must download both the new `AssetL` via `content_update_group` and the now-defunct `AssetL` via the untouched `Remote_Static` bundle. Regardless of the initial cache state, at some point the user will have the defunct `AssetL` on their device, cached indefinitely despite never being accessed. 

The best setup for your remote content will depend on your specific use case.
