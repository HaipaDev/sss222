# Privacy Compliance

Remote Config collects gameplay and device information from players who play your games.

In order to better understand your legal obligations to your players, you should ask:

+ Is your processing of Remote Config data automated without human intervention?
+ If yes, is your processing designed to carry out a contractual requirement or effect any other legal right?
+ Is your processing going to change the user’s experience in ways that are unique to him/her based on measuring his/her behavior?
+ Is your processing going to track the user’s location with a greater degree of certainty than 5km?
+ Is your processing going to consider data collected across web properties or devices?

If you answer yes to any of these questions, you should consult with your legal counsel as to whether a consent might be required from your end-users for the collection and processing of their data.

In the event that you determine that a consent is necessary under GDPR, Unity has created tools to help with your GDPR data privacy compliance. As such, if you made your game with Unity and you don’t use Unity Ads, we recommend you implement the Unity Data Privacy Plug-in. The Unity Data Privacy Plug-in generates a link inside your game that redirects the player to a web view where they can opt-out of data collection as well as delete existing data. It also allows players to view the relevant information that has been collected about them.The Unity Data Privacy Plug-in is available through the [Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/add-ons/services/unity-data-privacy-plug-in-118922).
Please also [see our documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityAnalyticsDataPrivacy.html).

The Unity Data Privacy Plug-in may be updated from time to time in order to assist in your compliance with new data protection regulations, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act. Information about such updates, if any, will be provided in the [Unity GDPR and Data Privacy – FAQ](https://unity3d.com/legal/gdpr) and the above-linked documentation.
