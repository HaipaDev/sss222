# Remote Config REST APIs
Though you must implement Unity Remote Config in your game code, you can update any [Rules and Settings](RulesAndSettings.md) stored by the service using Unityâ€™s REST API. For a comprehensive list of available functions, please read the full [REST API documentation](https://remote-config-api-docs.uca.cloud.unity3d.com/).
